# cwfs-report

This report provides a gentle introduction to semantics of type theory and categories with families,
and aims to be understandable to complete beginners. We only assume background in category theory
and basic type theory. We first discuss the syntactic model of type theory, then define CwFs, then
see two more models - the set model and the groupoid model.
